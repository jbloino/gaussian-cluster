== 2019-04-15

* Added possibility to set a project name ('`-P`' in `qsub`) in `gxx_qsub`, using `-p` or `--project`.

== 2019-03-25
=== Fixed
* Option for the temporary directory.

== 2019-01-24
=== Fixed
* `gxx_qsub` incorrectly stated that the node did not have enough memory if a soft limit was put on the number of processors.
* `gxx_qsub` was unable to compute the memory requirements if the user asked to keep the number processors unchanged (`kc`) but let the memory be set automatically.
* New option to set up the temporary path for Gaussian execution in `gxx_qsub`.
* Support for "SkyLake" architectures in `gxx_qsub`.

== 2018-12-19
=== Added
* `gxx_qsub` checks the presence of soft and hard limits on the number of processors and RAM on each node family and acts accordingly to set up the default resources, warn the user or stops.

=== Fixed
* `%Mem` and `%NProcShared` values mixed in linked jobs (`gxx_qsub.py`)

== 2018-12-03

== 2018-11-06
=== Added
* Improved documentation.

=== Fixed
* Incorrect conversion of number of processors aliases in virtual queues to number of cores (`gxx_qsub.py`).
